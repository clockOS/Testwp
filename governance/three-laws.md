# Three Laws

## **First Law**

The community must ensure that all developers benefit from the contributions and efforts, and must actively work to maximize the collective profit of its members.

## **Second Law**

The community must act according to the consensus and decisions made by its members, as long as these actions do not conflict with the First Law.

## **Third Law**

The community must allocate a portion of the profit to sustain and develop the community, provided this does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
