**Decisions should be made by experts**

### For development-related decisions, the voting power is determined by

min(token,votes,level)
$$

### Technical decision

min(token,votes,skill\ level)
$$

Developer can state token to vote, the upper limit is decided by the number of [votes ](../earn/rewards.md#votes)and [level](../earn/rewards.md#experience).
