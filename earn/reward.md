## Principles

### Value Every Contribution

Your contribution is like water in the desert; every drop matters.&#x20;

Even if you just correct a typo, you'll be rewarded.

Unlike in conventional way, in the step learning program⓪, finding a project to practice① and coding interview⑤ you will not get rewarded.

### Equal Pay for Equal Work

No interview④, regardless the gender, age, race, education background, disability etc.

And no internship⑥

### Fully Remote

Work from anywhere—no need to commute⑧ or relocate⑦. Benefit from lower living costs and avoid visa hassles and high housing prices.

### Freedom from Unemployment
